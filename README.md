# Food Truck Finder

Simple command-line program that print out a list of food trucks in San Francisco.

### How to install dependencies

run `npm install` to install required dependencies

### How to run application

in order to run the application run `node app` inside root folder after successfull `npm install`

Once application is started it will display `commands` with help message.

### What I would do differently if I were asked to build web

If asked to develop web application, then I would choose Angular framework and will create different angular components like MapView, ListView, Truck Detail, Search Bar and Filter to display all open food trucks on first page for customers based on their location.

From coding standpoint I do not think there will be huge difference, except printing into console, data will be stored in service and will be displayed on view. Instead of some switch case logic there will just some button action control methods in components.
